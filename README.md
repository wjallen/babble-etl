# Data Processing and Analysis Tool Documentation

### Overview

This documentation outlines the process of data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and analysis of a CSV file using a configuration file in JSON format.


## JSON Configuration Structure
Below is an example of a JSON configuration file structure:

```console
clean_data.json

{
    "data_file": "path/to/your/input.csv",
    
    "columns": [
        "Nest ID", 
        "Nestling ID", 
        "Nestling", 
        "Sex", 
        "Treatment",
    ],
    
    "transformations": {
        "Nest ID": "strip",
        "Date": "to_datetime"
    },
    
    "fill_na": {
        "numeric": 0,
        "string": ""
    },
    
    "rename_columns": {
        "Cluster6": "Babbles",
        "Bout ID (sans subtype)": "Bout ID", 
        "Bout no.": "Bout Number",
        "No. eggs hatched from nest": "Number eggs hatched from nest",
        "No. birds fledged from nest": "Number birds fledged from nest"
    },
   
    "data_types": {
        "Nest ID": "str",
        "Nestling ID": "str",
    }
}
```

## Key Fields in the JSON File
* data_file: Path to the raw CSV file to be processed.
* columns: List of columns to be included in the dataset.
* transformations: Dictionary specifying any transformations to be applied to the data.
* fill_na: Dictionary for handling missing values in specific columns.
* rename_columns: Dictionary mapping original column names to new names.
* data_types: Dictionary specifying data types for columns, if applicable.


## Command Line Arguments

The following command-line arguments can be used to run the script:

| Argument             | Type   | Required | Default | Description                                                                                     |
|----------------------|--------|----------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -i, --input          | String | Yes      | N/A     | Path to the input JSON file for data cleaning and transformation steps.                         |
| -m, --minlength      | Int    | No       | 2       | Minimum length for sequences used in pair analysis.                                             |
| -k, --kmeans         | Int    | No       | 6       | Number of clusters for k-means clustering.                                                      |
| -a, --analysis       | String | No       | N/A     | Type of frequency analysis to perform (choices: singles, pairs, triples, quads, quints, all).   |
| -d, --dump           | Flag   | No       | False   | Flag to indicate if sequences should be dumped into a plot.                                     |
| -l, --loglevel       | String | No       | WARNING | Log level for script execution (choices: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).                |
| -sc, --sequenceclass | String | No       | N/A     | Name of Columns in Data Frame to configure the data input for the Sequence Classification Model |


## Script Workflow

1. **Configuration Parsing:**
    * The script reads the JSON configuration file specified by the -i argument.
2. **Data Extraction:**
    * The CSV file specified in data_file is loaded.
3. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
    * The script applies column selection, renaming, transformations, and missing value handling as defined in the JSON configuration.
4. **Analysis:**
    * Depending on the --analysis argument, the script performs sequence analysis, including singles, pairs, triples, quads, or quints.
5. **Logging:**
    * Log messages are configured based on the --loglevel argument for better tracking and debugging.
6. **Dumping Sequences:**
    * If --dump is specified, the processed sequences are saved for further inspection.
7. **Sequence Classification:**
    * Depending on the --sequenceclass argument, the script performs setting up the df and csv for the Sequence Classification Model

## Example Usage

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python script_name.py -i config.json -m 3 -k 5 -a pairs -l INFO --dump --sc "Sex, Treatment"
```

### Explanation:
* Reads configuration from config.json.
* Minimum sequence length is set to 3.
* Runs k-means clustering with 5 clusters.
* Performs pair analysis.
* Logs messages at INFO level.
* Dumps sequences into a plot.
* Makes corresponding df and cvs for Sex and Treatment


## Logging

Logs are configured to display timestamps, log levels, and messages to help track the script's progress and troubleshoot any issues.

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
```

## Return Value

The script does not return a value but writes logs and, if specified, dumps sequence outputs for plotting.


## ANOVA Testing
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is an extremely important method in exploratory and confirmatory data analysis. ANOVA test can be a valuable tool for exploratory data analysis (EDA) when you want to identify potential differences in the mean of a continuous variable across different categorical groups within your dataset, helping you explore potential relationships and patterns between variables.

#### Why ANOVA is useful in EDA:

1. **Group comparisons:**
When exploring a dataset, ANOVA can quickly reveal whether there are statistically significant differences between various groups, allowing you to focus your analysis on those areas. 

2. **Identifying potential relationships:**
By comparing means across different groups, ANOVA can highlight potential relationships between categorical variables and continuous variables, prompting further investigation. 

3. **Data exploration:**
Even if you don't have a specific hypothesis in mind, running an ANOVA can help you discover interesting patterns in your data that might warrant further exploration. 

4. **Data visualization:**
The results of an ANOVA can be used to inform visualizations like box plots or bar charts, which can visually represent the differences between groups. 

####  When to Use ANOVA in EDA
* Independent Variable: Categorical (e.g., sex, treatment groups).
* Dependent Variable: Continuous (e.g., vocalization frequency or amplitude).

#### How to Use ANOVA for EDA
1. **One-Way ANOVA:** Test differences among means for one categorical independent variable.
    - Example: Do parrot vocalizations differ based on sex (male vs. female)?

2. **Two-Way ANOVA:** Explore interaction effects between two categorical independent variables.
    - Example: Is there an interaction between sex and treatment on vocalization patterns?

3. **Post-Hoc Tests:** If the ANOVA reveals significant differences, use post-hoc tests (like Tukey's HSD) to determine which groups differ from each other.

4. **Visualization:** Complement ANOVA results with visualizations (e.g., boxplots, violin plots) to help interpret differences in group means.
